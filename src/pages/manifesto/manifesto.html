        <ion-item text-wrap>
            <p>Over fifty years ago the first President of the United Republic of Tanzania, the late Mwalimu Julius K. Nyerere,recognized the integral part wildlife plays in this country. In September 1961 at a symposium on the Conservation of Nature and
                Natural Resources, he gave a speech that laid the foundation for conservation in post independent Tanzania. The extract of that speech has become known as the Arusha Manifesto.</p>

            <p>“The survival of our wildlife is a matter of grave concern to all of us in Africa. These wild creatures amid the wild places they inhabit are not only important as a source of wonder and inspiration but are an integral part of our natural
                resources and our future livelihood and well being. In accepting the trusteeship of our wildlife, we solemnly declare that we will do everything in our power to make sure that our children’s grandchildren will be able to enjoy this rich
                and precious inheritance. The conservation of wildlife and wild places calls for specialist knowledge, trained manpower, and money and we look to other nations to co-operate with us in this important task - the success or failure of which
                not only affects the continent of Africa but the rest of the world as well.”</p>
